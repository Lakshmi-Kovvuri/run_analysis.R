GETTING AND CLEANING DATA - Coursera Project

Assignment:
	  The purpose of this project is to prepare new tidy data set from the 'UCI HAR dataset' given in the assignment.
  
Prerequisites:
    ⦁	A full description is available in the following web address, where the data was obtained.     
	      http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
  
    ⦁	Data for this project is obtained in this URL
        https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
        
    ⦁	The 'UCI HAR Dataset. zip' needs to be unpacked provided in the folder - UCI HAR Dataset.
    
FILES:
    ⦁	Codebook.md:
	   This markdown file describes the variables, the data and any transformations that I performed to clean up the data.
    
   ⦁ run_analysis.R
       The R-script in this file performs the data preparation and conducts the following 5 functions 
       which were specified in the project.
          1.	Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.
          2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
          3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
          4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
          5.	From the data set in step-4, creates a second, idependent tidy data set with the average
            of each variable for each activity and each subject.
	    
⦁	Tidy.txt 
 	   This "Tidy.txt" file is the final step of this project which contains neat and organized data.
